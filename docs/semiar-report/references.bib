    abstract = "{Summary: Morpheus is a modeling environment for the simulation and integration of cell-based models with ordinary differential equations and reaction-diffusion systems. It allows rapid development of multiscale models in biological terms and mathematical expressions rather than programming code. Its graphical user interface supports the entire workflow from model construction and simulation to visualization, archiving and batch processing.Availability and implementation: Binary packages are available at http://imc.zih.tu-dresden.de/wiki/morpheus for Linux, Mac OSX and MS Windows.Contact:walter.deback@tu-dresden.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
